- Add ability to specify flag defaults in ~/.config/projects for each command
- Modify node-helmsman so that it doesn't require() all files (and add ability
  to specify description, etc. from the helmsman object); this will be a large
  speed increase
- Be as `git`-like as possible when the concepts are similar/the same to prevent
  having to learn a new way of doing things
- Flesh out the query API (by number of issues, by last update, by dirty status,
  by number of collaborators, number of npm stars, number of packages used,
  etc.)
- Open a browser on Windows, Linux (just uses OS X `open` right now)
- A web API and examples of what you'd do with it
- Add GET/POST/DELETE/PUT to the web API and add the concept of a master
  repository?
- More well-defined attributes
- Think more about efficiency
- Get more people to write commands
- Talk to people about their workflows
- More workflows for Alfred
- `projects grep` for grepping (or git grepping) all files in projects
